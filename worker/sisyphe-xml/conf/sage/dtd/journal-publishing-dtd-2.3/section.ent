<!-- ============================================================= -->
<!--
     =============================================================

Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.3                       (DAL/BTU) v2.3 (2007-02-02)
     
     Enhancement Release (2.3) following the Working Group meetings 
     of Oct-Nov/2006-Jan/2007. No backward-incompatible changes.
     Archiving loosened even more. New structures for all the DTDs. 
     
  7. FLOATS WRAPPER - Added new element <floats-wrap> to be used to
     hold the floating objects (figures, tables, text boxes, graphics, 
     etc.) that occur throughout an <article> in on place all
     together at the end of the <body> of the article, rather than 
     letting them appear where they are referenced. New PE
     floats-wrap-model.
     
  6. Updated public identifier to "v2.3 20070202//EN"          

     =============================================================
     Version 2.2                       (DAL/BTU) v2.2 (2006-04-30)
     
     Backwards-compatible changes to meet operational needs.
     Typical changes include adding attribute values and making 
     required elements optional.
          
  5. SECTION METADATA - Added new element <sec-meta>. There are 
     sections that are authored independently, even in journal 
     articles, and this is the start of allowing additional metadata 
     for such sections.
     
  4. Updated public identifier to "v2.3 20070202//EN"          

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-08-30)
     
     Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
     DTD version "2.0":
       a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
          DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
          archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
          current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
          archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
          DTD).
       b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
          and June/July 2004 followup discussions
       c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
          modularization requirements
       d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
          easier and more consistent

  3. COMPLETE MODELS WHEN OVER-RIDING A MODEL 
     (for all Parameter Entities suffixed "-model")
     ### Customization Alert ###
     Added internal parentheses to Parameter Entity and removed 
     them from Element Declaration for:
     - %sec-model;

  2. DEFAULT CLASSES - Were moved from this module to 
     %default-classes.ent;
  
  1. Updated public identifier to "v2.3 20070202"          
                                                                   -->

<!--                    This container element is just a wrapper to
                        hold the floating objects that occur within
                        an article. Some publishers like to
                        collect all these floating objects (figures,
                        tables, text boxes, graphics, etc.) together
                        at the end  rather than interspersing them
                        throughout the various parts of the document
                        where they are referenced. As such,

                        of an article, it holds article resources.
                        Remarks: This element was added because some
                        users of the DTD were adding an extra fake
                        section <sec> at the end of the body to hold
                        the floating material. This is clearly tag
                        abuse since a <sec> should contain authored 
                        content.                                   -->

                        practice is to use values as defined in

                        may be assigned a "type" attribute for

                        one type should have the type IDs combined.

                        'Methodology" Section always looks like a 
                        particular level heading (say a level 2 head),
                        wherever it falls in the hierarchy (say a 
                        level 1 head or a level 3 head). This
                        attribute can be used to record the needed
                        display level. (Rare)                      -->

<!--                    In some articles, each section has a different
                        author or some sections are authored by 
                        different contributors from the enclosing
                        article. This wrapper element for 
                        section-level metadata is used to capture
                        information concerning those contributors. -->
