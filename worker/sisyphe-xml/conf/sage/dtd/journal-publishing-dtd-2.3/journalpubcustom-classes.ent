<!--             This DTD (in contrast to the Journal Archiving    -->

<!--             choices in the models within this DTD, and some   -->

<!--

Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.3                       (DAL/BTU) v2.3 (2007-02-02)
     
     Enhancement Release (2.3) following the Working Group meetings 
     of Oct-Nov/2006-Jan/2007. No backward-incompatible changes.
     Archiving loosened even more. New structures for all the DTDs. 
     
  7. EMPHASIS CLASS - Added new element to the emphasis.class:
     - <sans-serif>
     
  6. NAME CLASS - Added <anonymous> to name.class, thereby adding
     it to <contrib> and <person-group> for both metadata and 
     reference use.
     
  5. REFERENCES CLASS - Added the following elements to the
     contents of the parameter entity -%references.class; thereby 
     adding them to
        - <citation>
        - <product>
        - <related-article>
     
     a. CONFERENCE SPONSOR - <conf-sponsor> 
     
     b. Institution <institution> (for CrossRef compatibility)
     
  4. NLM CITATION - Added <nlm-citation> as an alternative to
     unstructured <citation>s by adding <nlm-citation>
     to -%citation.class;. This changed the models for:
      - <ref>, which uses -%citation.class; inside %ref-model;
      
  3. Updated public identifier to "v2.3 20070202//EN"          

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                  (Beck/DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-08-30)
     
     
     Minor tweaks before public release. Decision was made not to
     change release number

  2. SEC BACK CLASS - Deleted over-ride. Publishing will use Base
     definition
  
     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-08-30)
          
     Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
     DTD version "2.0":
       a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
          DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
          archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
          current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
          archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
          DTD).
       b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
          and June/July 2004 followup discussions
       c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
          modularization requirements
       d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
          easier and more consistent
     
                
  1. Created this module from material previously in the single
     journal publishing customization module (journalpubcustomize.ent)
     Created at version "v2.3 20070202"                            -->
