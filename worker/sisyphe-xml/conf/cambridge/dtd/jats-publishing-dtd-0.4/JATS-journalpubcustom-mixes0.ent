<!--

Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)
   
     =============================================================
     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, NLM "Version 3.1 Draft" has 
     been changed to NISO "Version 0.4". No model, attribute, or
     parameter entity changes were made as part of this renaming.
   
     Details on NISO Tial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
   
  3. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131//EN", 
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".

     =============================================================
     Version 3.1                       (DAL/BTU) v3.1 (2010-04-30)

     Version 3.1 is fully compatible with Version 3.0.

     Details on version 3.1 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/3.1.

  2. Updated public identifier to "v3.1 20100830//EN"

     =============================================================
     Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)

     Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
     In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
     elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
     to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
     All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite
     web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.

     Details on version 3.0 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.

<!--                    Only the simplest of the typographic
                        emphasis elements, as well as subscript and
                        superscript.  Usually used in a model that
                        allows #PCDATA and this restricted mixture.
                        This mix may be stripped down to only
                        subscript and superscript by some, more
                        restrictive DTDs.
                        MAINTENANCE NOTE: This Parameter Entity
                        and the related PE "rendition-plus" have
                        been put in place to restrict the amount of
                        variability that a person modifying the DTD
                        through PE redefinition can achieve. Some
                        elements have been set #PCDATA plus one PE
                        and some have been set to #PCDATA plus the
                        other in an effort to allow designers to
                        modify entire groups of elements, but not
                        to change similar models individually .    -->
