Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)
   
     =============================================================
     NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-xx-xx)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (Version 1.0) 

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs, XSDs, 
     RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.0/
   
 19. RELATED OBJECT - Added <related-object> everywhere
     <related-article> was used, including inside 
     <article-meta> using article-meta-model.

 18. CONTRIBUTOR MODEL - Added "contrib-id.class" to the beginning
     at the <contrib> model, to hold identifiers for people,
     such as publishers-specific IDs and ORCIDs.
      
 17. STANDARDS ORGANIZATION - Added std-organization-elements
     to reduce what was allowed in the names of standards bodies.
   
 16. JOURNAL METADATA MODEL
     - Added <issn-l> as an optional element to <journal-meta>
     - Added contributors and affiliations to journal metadata through
       contrib-group.class (which resolves to <contrib-group>) and 
       aff-alternatives.class (which resolves to <aff> or
       <aff-alternatives>), using the journal-meta-model.
   
 15. JOURNAL METADATA MODEL
      
 14. PARAGRPH PARAMETER ENTITY SYNTAX CHANGE (no models changed)
     Fixed content models that were stated as "p*" and "sec*"
     to use the %just-para.class;, %sec.class, and %ref-list.class; 
     classes. Element models that were changed include:
      - abstract
      - ack
      - trans-abstract
   
 13. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "1.0" and the formal
     public identifier to the date: "v1.0 20120330//EN".

     =============================================================
     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
     "Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
   
 12. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
   
 11. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".

 10. POSITION ATTRIBUTE - Added the value "background"

  9. PREFORMAT - Added <alt-text> and <long-desc> to <preformat> by
     adding %access.class; to %preformat-elements;

  8. INITIALS - Removed the attribute over-ride for <surname> and
     <given-names> to allow the use of @initials.

  7. JOURNAL METADATA- Added <notes> to repeat within <journal-meta>
     (through %journal-meta-model; and added @xml:lang and
     @specific-use to the attributes of <notes> through %notes-atts;

  6. AFFILIATION ALTERNATIVES - Added the element <aff-alternatives>
     to <article-meta> through %article meta-model;. This element
     will hold multiple <aff>s that are a representation of a
     single affiliation, for example, the name of an institution
     in two languages or two scripts.

  5. PERSON-GROUP - Became a mixed-content model, so the parameter
     entity %person-group-model: was changed to
     %person-group-elements;, which will be mixed with #PCDATA
     as defined in references.ent. The PE person-group-model has
     been retained in references.ent for compatibility, but has been
     set to the mixed model using person-group-elements.

  4. @SPECIFIC-USE and @XML:LANG - Added the @specific-use and
     @xml:lang to %display-atts;. Also added these attributes
     to the following over-rides:
      - inline-graphic through inline-graphic-atts (both)
      - fn through fn-atts (added @specific-use, @xml:lang already
          there)
      - person-group through person-group-atts (both)

  3. LABEL - Added optional <label> to <fig-group> using
     %fig-group-model; as the first element in model, before caption

  2. SELF URI - Added <self-uri> to <journal-meta> (directly
     following <notes>) so that an XML document can point to the
     journal home page.

     =============================================================
     Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)

     Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
     In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
     elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
     to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
     All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite
     web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.

     Details on version 3.0 are available at
           http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.

  1. Updated public identifier to "v3.0 20080202//EN"              -->
