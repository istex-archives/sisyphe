<!--

Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)
   
     =============================================================
     NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-xx-xx)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (Version 1.0) 

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs, XSDs, 
     RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.0/
   
 18. RELATED OBJECT - Added <related-object> everywhere
     <related-article> was used, including inside 
     <article-meta> using article-meta-model.

 17. CONTRIBUTOR MODEL - Added "contrib-id.class" to the 
     <contrib> model, to hold identifiers for people,
     such as publishers-specific IDs,  and ORCIDs.
   
 16. VERSE-LINE ELEMENTS - Added the PE %verse-line-elements to
     this module because the default expanded, and Archiving did
     not need to expand as it already was expanded.
   
 14. DATE ATTRIBUTES - Added attributes to <date> through @date-atts: 
       a) @iso-8601-date - ISO 8601 standard date format
          of the publication date. Format  YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss 
       b) @calendar - Name of the calendar used (@calendar) in
          naming this publication date (such as "Gregorian", 
          "Japanese" (Emperor years), or "Islamic").
       c) Added @publication-format, so that both publication
          dates and history dates can separate the format of the
          publication from the version/lifecycle event. Thus
          both an "article" and a "manuscript" might be received.
   
 13. STANDARDS ORGANIZATION - Added std-organization-elements
     to increase what was allowed in the names of standards bodies.

 12. XREF REF TYPES - #9 below says "XREF ATTRIBUTES - Removed 
     the %xref-atts PE from this module since the regular version 
     (in xlink3.ent) was equally inclusive. But it is NOT. 
     Brought back %xref-atts;
   
 11. ISSN-L ELEMENTS - Added <X> TO <issn-l> via 
     %issn-l-elements;

     =============================================================
     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
     "Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
   
 10. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
   
  9. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/0.4.

  7. XREF ATTRIBUTES - Removed the %xref-atts PE from this module
     since the regular version (in xlink3.ent) was equally inclusive.

  6. ISSUE - Allowed to repeat inside <article-meta>

  5. AFFILIATION ALTERNATIVES - Added the element <aff-alternatives>
     to <article-meta> through %article meta-model;. This element
     will hold multiple <aff>s that are a representation of a
     single affiliation, for example, the name of an institution
     in two languages or two scripts.

  4. PERSON-GROUP - Became a mixed-content model, so the parameter
     entity %person-group-model: was changed to
     %person-group-elements;, which will be mixed with #PCDATA
     as defined in references.ent. The PE person-group-model has
     been retained in references.ent for compatibility, but has been
     set to the mixed model using person-group-elements.

  3. @SPECIFIC-USE and @XML:LANG - Added the @specific-use and
     @xml:lang to %display-atts;. Also added these attributes
     to the following over-rides:
      - article-id through article-id-atts (@specific-user only)
      - award-id through award-id-atts (both)
      - date through date-atts (@specific-use only)
      - funding-statement through funding-statement-atts (both)
      - pub-id through pub-id-atts (@specific-use only)
      - trans-title through pub-id-atts (@specific-use only;
         @xml:lang already)
      - xref through xref-atts (both)

  2. STRING-DATE - Added <string-date> back to the following
     elements using %citation-additions.class;. It was accidentally
     deleted during the 3.0 revision of references.class:
      - product         (%product-elements;)
      - related-article (%related-article-elements;)
      - related-object  (%related-object-elements;)
      - funding-statement through funding-statement-atts (both)

     =============================================================
     Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)

     Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
     In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
     elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
     to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
     All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite
     web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.

     Details on version 3.0 are available at
           http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.

  1. Updated public identifier to "v3.0 20080202//EN"              -->
