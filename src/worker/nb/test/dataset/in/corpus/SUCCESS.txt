Knowing the extent of inundation areas for individual N-year flood events, the specific flood scenarios, and having an idea about the depths and velocities in the longitudinal or transverse water course profile provided by hydrodynamic models is of key importance for protecting peoplesâ€™ lives and mitigating damage to property. Input data for creating the watercourse computational geometry are crucial for hydrodynamic models. Requirements for input data vary with respect to the hydrodynamic model used. One-dimensional (1D) hydrodynamic models in which the computing track is formed by cross-sectional profiles of the channel are characterized by lower requirements for input data. In two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic models, a digital terrain model is needed for the entire area studied. Financial requirements of the project increase with regard to the input data and the model used. The increase is mainly due to the high cost of the geodetic surveying of the stream channel. The paper aims at a verification and presentation of the suitability of using hydrological measurements in developing a schematization (geometry) of water courses based on topographic data gained from aerial laser scanning provided by the Czech Office for Surveying, Mapping and Cadastre. Taking into account the hydrological measurement during the schematization of the water course into the hydrodynamic model consists in the derivation of flow rate achieved at the time of data acquisition using the method of aerial laser scanning by means of hydrological analogy and in using the established flow rate values as a basis for deepening of the digital terrain model from aerial laser scanning data. Thus, the given principle helps to capture precisely the remaining part of the channel profile which is not reflected in the digital terrain model prepared by the method of aerial laser scanning and fully correct geometry is achieved for the hydrodynamic model.
